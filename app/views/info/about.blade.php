					<p>The founder of TFS packed her bags to leave Australian shores to backpack around the world.
It was to be a life changing decision in more ways than one.</p>
<img src="/images/dumbrenee.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right img-small" />
<p>Meandering through continents and nations, she arrived at the charming Buenos Aires in 
Argentina and noticed that she badly needed a haircut. Destiny took her to a salon where an 
Argentinean hair stylist not only cut her hair but also invited the very curious Australian tourist 
to her home to share an authentic and traditional Argentine meal that had been prepared by 
her grandma. That evening, surrounded with laughter and the warm hospitality of strangers 
who felt very much like her own, she savoured asado, empanadas and yerba mate, and made 
the wondrous discovery of an authentic home cooked meal. She was discovering not just the 
wonders of the world but also the flavours of the world.</p> 
<p>A year later a very much recharged Renee was back in Australia and determined to make all 
those wonderful dishes she had tasted on her journeys in her own home kitchen. What she 
had not factored in was the simple fact that while she loved food, her cooking skills left a lot to 
be desired! She invited a few friends over for ‘a welcome home dinner’ and ended up with a 
culinary disaster on hands! She had to take her friends to a restaurant instead but was met with 
a long wait for table, indifferent food, impersonal service and a hefty bill that together made the 
evening eminently forgettable.</p>
<p>Then destiny took her hand again and she met an Argentinian guy in Sydney. They bonded 
over beers and she accompanied him to an empanada party on the weekend. And there she 
once again enjoyed the marvellously original flavours like she had in South America. In fact, that 
experience was so unforgettable that she wanted to share it with everyone else.</p>
<p>This is how TFS was born.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>TFS aims to introduce a new way of private dining to food aficionados across Australia.</p>
